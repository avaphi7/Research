# Research
A collection of code and materials related to my research.

#### Workflow
Adding files:
- `git add [filename]`
- `git commit -m"[descriptive message]"`
- `git push personal main`

Retrieving files from Github
- do the "adding files" section above
- ensure that there is nothing to commit by typing `git status`
- git pull personal main
